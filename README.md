# Dungeon-Crawl

Move using the w,a,s,d keys.

T are traps, M are monsters, X is the treasure. If you touch traps or make contact with monsters you die. Monsters may move every time you do.

You can enter multiple commands before clicking enter. That will make as much turns pass as the number of moves made.
